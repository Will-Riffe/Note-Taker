  ## Reference
  Thanks goes out to EdX and Rutgers Coding Bootcamps for the starter code, as well as to [Collin McCarter's Code](https://github.com/collin-mccarter/Note-Taker) on GitHub for the inspiration towards certain aspects of the routes (although I may have implimented it more appropriately, since they put all of their route informaiton in the server.js of their code).
